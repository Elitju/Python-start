#Testing list manipulation

list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
print(list[2:4])
# starting from 0, runs number 2 and 3 but not 4
print(list[2:-5])
#similarly 2 to -6 not -5, where - is starting count from right
print(len(list))
#len displays correct number of lenght of list, what did i think would happen, actually no im trying to really solidify fundementals idc if it sounds stupid

print(list[::-1])
#reverses list

list_c = ['red','green','blue','yellow']
print(list_c.pop())
print(list_c)
#removed last item for rest of code, not permanent

print(list.reverse())
#none??

print(list_c.reverse())
#also none..?

#will figure out more day 2
