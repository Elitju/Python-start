# Python-start
Im going to start learning stuff, i guess
the aim is to learn python and do some projects
probably start with simple stuff, calculator, vending machine, along those lines
ill see how complicated i go, maybe delve into machine learning etc.
later on i wanna try learn C also, maybe some front end, back end stuff to get a rounded grip of coding
no set in stone plan at the moment, but there's ambition
